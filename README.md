This report presents a comprehensive analysis of water samples collected from various locations in
the Wardha region. The study aimed to assess the water quality parameters including pH, color, odor,
turbidity (NTU), hardness of water, residual chlorine, chloride (Cl), fluoride (Fl), iron (Fe), nitrate (N),
arsenic, and coliform bacteria. The samples were collected systematically and geographically mapped
using Google Maps for precise location tracking. Laboratory analysis was conducted to measure these
parameters, and the results were compared against relevant water quality standards. The area-wise
data was compiled in a table format, providing a spatial overview of water quality variations across the
region. The findings of this study contribute to a better understanding of the overall water quality status
in different areas of Wardha and identify potential sources of contamination. Recommendations for
remedial actions and future monitoring strategies are discussed, aiming to ensure the provision of safe
and clean water to the community
